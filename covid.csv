In my opinion,teachers can provide video lectures through sharing video and having this online meetings at aday per week to discuss about dbts ,etcDue to this hrs of online classes ,we are finding difficulty in data charges and also the college is asking for semester fee like 50,000(we are using our oen money to recharge and nvr using any facilities from colleges)due to this pandemic,many families are having trouble with money

They minimize the topic for faster completion of portions. This is such a big crisis which leaves no good for students. The best alternative is that the teachers should provide recorded video lectures and assignments by avoiding the continuous online classes and assignments should be marked as the attendance. This reduces stress of students. The online classes is a platform for teachersto impose maximum stress on students by stating that ""students get enough and more time since they spend every minute at home"". This has become an excuse for teachers to impose maximum work upon students. This should change. "
